# Go Fiber API Server with JWT Authentication

This project is a **robust API server** built with [Go Fiber](https://gofiber.io/).  
It includes **JWT authentication** and follows best practices for structuring a production-ready API.

## Features
- User registration and login with password hashing (bcrypt)  
- JWT-based authentication (login generates token, middleware protects routes)  
- Public and protected routes  
- Clean project structure with separation of concerns  
- Graceful shutdown support  
- Environment variable configuration
